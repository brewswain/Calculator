# Calculator

### This project's goals include :

- Creating a functional On-screen calculator using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- The functionality will be simple, using basic math operators Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

- It should allow multiple arguments to be used in one line and be accurate.

- Don't allow division by 0 :)

## Goals to be accomplished after Main design is proven to work as designed:

- There should be "Clear", and decimal functionality implemented.

- Having a "Backspace" button to undo steps

- Keyboard support

### Goals have mostly been completed on the 3rd of May, 2019 . I decided to not implement keyboard support thus yet as I was impatient to begin learning about functionality of Python and Django. However, I may come back to edit this calculator app as I'm really happy with how it came out.
